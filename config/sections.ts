 * Section background variants — edit this file per client.

 *   "default" → bg-background  (plain white / dark)
 *   "muted"   → bg-muted/40    (subtle gray)
 *   "accent"  → bg-accent      (brand tint)
 *   "primary" → bg-primary     (full brand color)
 *
 * Colors are driven by CSS variables in app/globals.css,
 * so they automatically reflect the client's brand palette.
